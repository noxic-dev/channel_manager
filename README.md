**Channel Manager** is a Discord bot designed to simplify and enhance channel management for your server. Developed by a solo developer, it offers powerful tools and intuitive commands to streamline managing your server's channels.

## 🚀 About This Project

The journey of **Channel Manager** began with its first iteration, **ChannelManager V1**, which was written in **JavaScript** and featured a single command: `/nuke`. This command cloned a channel and deleted the original, providing a simple yet effective solution for channel cleanup.

With the release of **ChannelManager V2**, the bot has evolved into a robust, feature-rich tool. Now rewritten in **TypeScript**, it retains the core functionality of `/nuke` (renamed `/prune-channel`) while introducing new capabilities and becoming **open-source** for greater transparency.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Purge**: Use `/purge <1 - 500>` to delete messages in a channel (This does not affect the channel itself).
- **Improved Commands**: Use `/prune-channel` (formerly `/nuke`) to safely clone and clean up channels.
- **Open-Source**: Available for everyone to review and contribute to on GitHub.
